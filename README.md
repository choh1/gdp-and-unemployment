# GDP and Unemployement

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better.
This project illustrates how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate in the United States.
